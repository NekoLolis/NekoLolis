<h1>hii, I'm Neko, also known as Kurom 👋</h1><br />

I’m the founder and CEO of **Kurom Softworks LTD**, where our mission is simple, **Security Done Right.**  

My journey in cybersecurity started with a curiosity about how systems break — and more importantly, how to make them stronger. Over the years, that curiosity turned into a career focused on:  
- 🔐 Building **robust security solutions** that people can actually rely on  
- 🧩 Designing frameworks that bridge **complex security** with **practical usability**  
- 📈 Helping individuals and organizations raise their **security maturity** without the unnecessary jargon  

---

I believe that:  
- Competence should be the **default standard** in security  
- Security should **empower**, not restrict  
- True security comes from **clarity, adaptability, and trust**  

For me, it’s not just about protecting systems, it’s about building confidence in a digital world.
